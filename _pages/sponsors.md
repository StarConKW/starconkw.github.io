The [Mathematics Endowment Fund](https://uwaterloo.ca/math-endowment-fund/about) (MEF) is an income-generating fund that finances projects for the academic betterment of mathematics undergraduate students at the University of Waterloo. Members of the StarCon organizing committee have used MEF funding for previous projects on the Women in CS committee and for attending conferences. We're very grateful for their support. If you are a Waterloo math student and not in town for StarCon, we recommend reaching out to them for travel funding!
