## Why You Should Sponsor Us

By sponsoring StarCon, you will empower diverse perspectives in technology and contribute towards creating a community grounded in learning. You will also have the opportunity to actively interact with a group of people keenly interested in technology. You can leverage this opportunity to market your brand and product, create awareness of your core values and philosophies, share what it’s like to be a part of your organization, talk about your plans for the future, and recruit candidates for open positions.

In addition to this, you will be supporting our mission of providing people with a community in which they can share their excitement and ideas with others. You will help us meet our goals to keep this event affordable, encourage students to speak and attend, provide an accessible venue, make sure our attendees are well fed, and give them some swag to remember us by!
