## Steps on how to connect to the event's wifi

1. Connect to wireless SSID `uw-wifi-setup-no-encryption`
2. Go to your web-browser (you may need to visit a webpage to activate the portal - try going to [www.cbc.ca](www.cbc.ca)).
3. Once the portal pops up click the "here" link under "attending an event".
4. Enter your first, last name, email (_a real one you can check_), and the password that was provided in the email we sent out.
5. Check your email for a confirmation code and enter the confirmation code in the box where it's asked.
6. You should receive a "success" confirmation and you will then be registered for the duration of the event.
